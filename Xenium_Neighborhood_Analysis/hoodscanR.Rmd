### DATA PREPARATION ###

# STEP ONE
# load cell metadata and cell type annotations
cells_meta <- read.csv("/Users/stephreinert/Desktop/xenium/xen12_3990/cells.csv")
cell_annotations <- read.csv("/Users/stephreinert/Desktop/ometifs&csvs/hoodscanR_cell_annotations_3990.csv")  # contains 'cell_id' and 'group'

# merge metadata with cell annotations based on common 'cell_id'
# adds cell type info (stored in 'group') to the cells_meta DF
cells_meta <- merge(cells_meta, cell_annotations, by = "cell_id", all.x = TRUE)

# set rownames to cell_id so that they match column names in the count matrix
rownames(cells_meta) <- cells_meta$cell_id

# STEP TWO
# load Xenium gene expression data from HDF5 file
xenium_counts <- Read10X_h5("/Users/stephreinert/Desktop/xenium/xen12_3990/cell_feature_matrix.h5")

# assume the counts are under the "Gene Expression" group.
gene_counts <- xenium_counts[["Gene Expression"]]

# STEP THREE 
# create seurat object using the gene counts
xenium_seurat <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = gene_counts)

# STEP FOUR
# add the merged metadata (which now includes cell type information) to seurat object
xenium_seurat <- AddMetaData(xenium_seurat, metadata = cells_meta)

# normalize data (only if necessary)
xenium_seurat <- NormalizeData(xenium_seurat)

# STEP FIVE  ***START HERE IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A FULL SEURAT OBJ*** 
# convert the Seurat object to a SingleCellExperiment object 
query_sce <- as.SingleCellExperiment(xenium_seurat)

# STEP SIX
# extract spatial coordinates
# note: make sure the column names "x_centroid" and "y_centroid" match what is in your meta data
coords <- as.matrix(query_sce@colData[, c("x_centroid", "y_centroid")])

# STEP SEVEN
# create SpatialExperiment object using counts, metadata, and spatial coordinates
query_spe <- SpatialExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = assay(query_sce, "counts")),
  colData = colData(query_sce),
  spatialCoords = coords
)

# inspect resulting SpatialExperiment object
query_spe

```

```{r}

### HOODSCANR ANALYSIS ###

# run hoodscanR using "group" column from your colData for cell annotations
query_spe <- readHoodData(query_spe, anno_col = "group")

```


```{r}

# plot tissue
plotTissue(query_spe, color = cell_annotation, size = 1.5, alpha = 0.8)

```

```{r}

# calculate neighborhoods
fnc <- findNearCells(query_spe, k = 100)

pm <- scanHoods(fnc$distance)

hoods <- mergeByGroup(pm, fnc$cells)

plotHoodMat(hoods, n = 10, hm_height = 5)

```

```{r}

# merge neighborhood info and calculate metrics
query_spe <- mergeHoodSpe(query_spe, hoods)

query_spe <- calcMetrics(query_spe, pm_cols = colnames(hoods))

# shows where in the tissue cells have high or low neighborhood diversity, high entropy = high diversity
plotTissue(query_spe, size = 1.5, color = entropy) +
  scale_color_scico(palette = "tokyo")

# shows the effective number of neighboring cell types influencing each cell, high perplexity = complex/spread out hood
plotTissue(query_spe, size = 1.5, color = perplexity) +
  scale_color_scico(palette = "tokyo")

```


```{r}

### PEARSON CORRELATION ###
# shows which cell types or neighborhoods tend to occur together
# high pearson correlation = cells of those types often share similar local neighborhoods

plotColocal(query_spe, pm_cols = colnames(hoods))

```

```{r}

### CLUSTERING AND VISUALIZATION ###
# probability table shows which cell types (or neighborhood compositions) are most represented in each cluster
# one cluster might have a high probability for particular cell type, another might show a mixed neighborhood

# cluster by neighborhood and visualize on tissue
query_spe <- clustByHood(query_spe, pm_cols = colnames(hoods), k = 16)
plotTissue(query_spe, color = clusters)

# inspect the probability distribution per cluster
plotProbDist(query_spe, pm_cols = colnames(hoods), by_cluster = TRUE, 
             plot_all = TRUE, show_clusters = as.character(seq(16)))

```
